## Detecting COVID-19 induced Pneumonia from Chest X-rays with Transfer Learning using five architectures of Convolutional Networks.

X-ray datasets are provided by a range of groups considering PA and AP origin and , in a
image formats. It sets up a local database of
datasets that can be used for an integrated analysis that could be accessed throygh:
